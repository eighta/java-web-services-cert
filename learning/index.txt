***Lo que aprendera

This Java EE 6 programming course covers the design and creation of SOAP and RESTful web services and clients. You'll use the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop JAX-WS and JAX-RS web services and deploy those services to Oracle WebLogic Server 12c. The majority of topics covered are portable across all application servers which support the Java EE 6 web service standards.

Learn To:

Create XML documents and XML schemas while using XML Namespaces.
Produce and consume JSON and XML using JAXB.
Understand WSDL files and the role they play in SOAP based web services and select either a top-down (WSDL first) or bottom-up (code first) approach to the development of SOAP web services.
Make calls to and implement web services based on SOAP standards using JAX-WS (Metro Stack).
Implement REST practices in the creation of web services with the JAX-RS specification (Jersey Stack).
Secure web services using Java EE Security standards, WS-Security extensions, and OAuth 1.0a.

Java API for XML Web Services
=============================
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services

The Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) is a Java programming language API for creating web services, 
particularly SOAP services. JAX-WS is one of the Java XML programming APIs. It is part of the Java EE platform.

The JAX-WS 2.2 specification JSR 224 defines a standard Java- to-WSDL mapping which determines how WSDL operations 
are bound to Java methods when a SOAP message invokes a WSDL operation. This Java-to-WSDL mapping determines which 
Java method gets invoked and how that SOAP message is mapped to the method’s parameters.

JAX-WS uses annotations, introduced in Java SE 5, to simplify the development and deployment of web service clients and endpoints. 
It is part of the Java Web Services Development Pack. JAX-WS can be used in Java SE starting with version 6.[1] 
JAX-WS 2.0 replaced the JAX-RPC API in Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 which leans more towards document style Web Services.

This API provides the core of Project Metro, inside the GlassFish open-source Application Server community of Oracle Corporation.

JAX-WS also is one of the foundations of WSIT.
